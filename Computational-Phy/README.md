## Computational Physics & Statistical Mechanics
This repository includes a dedicated module for Computational Physics. These scripts explore fundamental physical phenomena through simulation, focusing on randomness, energy states, and dynamical systems.

## 1. Statistical Mechanics & Thermodynamics
1D Ising Model: A simulation of ferromagnetism using the Metropolis-Monte carlo algorithm to show how spins align at low temperatures.

Probability of Occupancy: Visualizing how particles distribute across energy levels (Boltzmann distribution) at varying temperature scales.

Probability Distributions: A deep dive into the "math of randomness" using Python libraries to visualize Gaussian, Poisson, exponential and Binomial behaviors. 

## 2. Random Walks & Stochastic Processes
1D & 2D Random Walks: Simulating the path of a particle under "drunkard’s walk" conditions—the foundation for understanding diffusion and Brownian motion.

pi Estimations: Using the Monte Carlo method to "throw darts" at a circle and calculate the value of pibased on hit-to-miss ratios.

## 3. Classical Dynamics
Molecular Dynamics (Basics): A look at how particles interact in a box, calculating trajectories based on inter-molecular forces.Harmonic & Damped Oscillators: Numerical solutions for systems with and without friction, comparing the energy loss over time
