## Numerical Methods (The Mathematical Engine)
The "toolbox" used to solve the math behind the physics. This section includes classic algorithms for when a pen-and-paper solution isn't possible.

Root Finding: Newton-Raphson, false position and Bisection methods.

Integration: Simpson’s 1/3 Rule and the Trapezoidal Rule for calculating areas under complex curves
